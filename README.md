  ## Approach to Day-to-Day Work:

  * To start, Ryan and Stephen will code on the backend, while Darshon and Emmanuel will code on the frontend. 
  * We will establish a time to meet, figure out what endpoints we are going to name what, and split off for an hour (woriking on each part of the project). 
  * We'll then meet up after the hour is up and do a liveshare on either the frontend or backend to make any adjustments needed for the code.

  ## Conlict Plan:

  * If a disagreement arises, teammates agree to be open and fair to what is being worked on. 
  * If someone has an issue with an individual, that person should resolve the issue at the lowest level by addressing them one on one.
  * Being transparent with one another, knowing that we do not know everything, and will not know everything, is the foundation we will build on.
  * For members who are not contributing, asking them how we can help them get on the same page as the group would be a good resolution.
  * The next step if a conflict is not resolved after 2 attempts would be to bring in Audrey.
